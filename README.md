Welcome to **ABT** â€” the ultimate multi-language syntax checking GitHub Actions workflow, crafted with love and brains by **B-HDâ„¢ & Slizâ„¢**. This bad boy automatically checks your code syntax across **110+ programming languages** every time you push or open a pull request.

## Why ABT?

- ðŸš€ **Speedy & smart** â€” catches syntax errors before they wreck your build.
- ðŸ’¼ **Multi-language support** â€” from Python and JavaScript to obscure languages like Nim and Futhark.
- ðŸ¤– **Automated environment setup** â€” no manual installs, just plug and play.
- ðŸ”¥ **Scalable** â€” perfect for solo devs, startups, or massive teams.
- ðŸŽ‰ **Made by the legends B-HDâ„¢ & Slizâ„¢** â€” because quality matters.

## How It Works

- Runs on **Ubuntu latest** virtual environment.
- Detects your project files by extension.
- Runs syntax checks using official language tools or compilers.
- Skips jobs gracefully if no relevant files are found.
- Reports errors early, keeping your codebase clean and shiny.

---

## Supported Languages

A whopping **100+ languages** including but not limited to:

- Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Ruby, PHP, Java, C, C++, Kotlin
- Rust, Swift, Scala, Perl, Bash, Lua, Elixir, Haskell, R
- And many more â€” check the full list in `ABT.yml`

## Usage

Add `ABT.yml` to your `.github/workflows` folder in your repo:

cd ABT
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp ABT.yml .github/workflows/
git add .github/workflows/ABT.yml

git push
```

**OR**

- Just copy file (ABT.yml)
