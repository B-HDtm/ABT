Welcome to **ABT** â€” the ultimate multi-language syntax checking GitHub Actions workflow, crafted with love and brains by **B-HDâ„¢ & Slizâ„¢**. This bad boy automatically checks your code syntax across **110+ programming languages** every time you push or open a pull request.

## Why ABT?

- ðŸš€ **Speedy & smart** â€” catches syntax errors before they wreck your build.
- ðŸ’¼ **Multi-language support** â€” from Python and JavaScript to obscure languages like Nim and Futhark.
- ðŸ¤– **Automated environment setup** â€” no manual installs, just plug and play.
- ðŸ”¥ **Scalable** â€” perfect for solo devs, startups, or massive teams.
- ðŸŽ‰ **Made by the legends B-HDâ„¢ & Slizâ„¢** â€” because quality matters.

## How It Works

- Runs on **Ubuntu latest** virtual environment.
- Detects your project files by extension.
- Runs syntax checks using official language tools or compilers.
- Skips jobs gracefully if no relevant files are found.
- Reports errors early, keeping your codebase clean and shiny.

## Supported Languages

A whopping **100+ languages** including but not limited to:

- Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Ruby, PHP, Java, C, C++, Kotlin

## Usage

Add `ABT.yml` to your `.github/workflows` folder in your repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/B-HDtm/ABT
cd ABT
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp ABT.yml .github/workflows/
git add .github/workflows/ABT.yml
git commit -m "Add ABT multi-language syntax checker"
git push
```

**OR**

- Just (copy; ctrl+a, ctrl+c) code in file (ABT.yml)
- Go to Action in your repo and select "create your own" and change the file name from main.yml to abt.yml and paste the save code into the code window (ctrl+v)
- Click save and enjoy)

**Update**

- To update, simply copy the code in the file (abt.yml in this repository) and replace the existing code in the abt.yml file in your repository with the copied code and you're done)
- If you still don't have an abt.yml file or even a .github folder, see above for instructions on how to install it, either via the Linux terminal or via the Github method (Download section: OR)

From now on, every push or PR triggers syntax checks automatically.
